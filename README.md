## Open Source GitHub Copilot for auto generating code

I would like to train an open source version of the new awesome GitHub Copilot AI tool, which is based on GPT3. Similar to the awesome people behind GPT-Neo, having such an open source model would greatly help researchers understand what this type of biases and limitations this kind of code autocompletion model might have such as generating insecure code (i do research in this area and i know my team would love an open sourced version to run experiments on, i.e. try and break it ðŸ¤“)
